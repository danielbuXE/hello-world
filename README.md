Hello Professor


I just wanted to say thanks for this really cool class professor. Learning all of HTTP and a bunch of uses in CSS was super cool, the JS was fun too but I felt like I needed to spend more time on it to get a bit more proficent on it but that is fine for now. For this summer I will just have to practice more JS so I get more used to it. Thanks for everything thing including the times you help me and my group out.
